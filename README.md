# Computer Crash

This game was developed in one week for the UTS Playmakers March Game Jam (2025).

Please note: This code is awful and I'm quite frankly embarassed that I wrote this, however it is all funtional, and that's all that matters considering the time constraints :).

Shell scripts were for personal development environment over multiple devices, and are not necessary for the game to funtion.
